"""Muon cyclotron sim-oracle plugin — the OUT-OF-TREE home of the bespoke SIMT grading oracle.

Declared by the muon target contract as ``plugin.sim_oracle`` and loaded by
:func:`merlin.targetgen.capsule_runner._ensure_sim_oracles_discovered` (as ``merlin._oot_sim_oracles.muon``)
through the SAME reference/OOT plugin discovery the runtime backends use. Importing this module registers
the ``cyclotron`` bespoke-sim oracle so a target that declares ``toolchain.sim_via == cyclotron`` (a
self-hosted SIMT core, e.g. radiance) routes to it — WITHOUT capsule_runner carrying a hardcoded
``_SIM_ORACLES["cyclotron"]`` entry.

Behaviorally IDENTICAL to the former hardcoded ``_cyclotron_adapters`` / ``_cyclotron_available`` in
capsule_runner: the adapters resolve to the (relocated) ``muon_oracles.default_adapters()`` and the
availability probe requires the cyclotron oracle via the muon backend's ``available("cyclotron")``, failing
closed (the mlc arc command-buffer adapter grades the wrong artifact for a SIMT target and is NOT a valid
fallback). This is a LEAF module (no submodule search), so it reaches the relocated muon package only via
the registry (``get_backend("muon")``).
