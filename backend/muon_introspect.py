"""Deterministic, no-LLM extraction of Muon (RadianceMuonConfig) hardware facts from the real RTL.

The Muon analog of :mod:`merlin.targetgen.rtl.circt_introspect` (Gemmini). The hardware is the source
of truth: every geometry fact here is read out of the **elaborated FIRRTL + module hierarchy + memory
macro list + device tree** that CIRCT/firtool produced for ``RadianceMuonConfig`` (under
``$MERLIN_CHIPYARD/sims/vcs/generated-src/...``), and emitted into one provenance-stamped
``muon_facts.json`` -- each fact carrying the exact RTL token it came from. Consumers (digest, advisory
checker, the manifest deriver, the fact-bundle renderer) read that artifact instead of re-deriving the
geometry by crawling Radiance Scala.

FACT SOURCE RULE (why this module was rewritten
===============================================
A hardware fact may only be derived from CIRCT output or the target's own RTL repo. The cyclotron
perf model (``MERLIN_MUON_CONFIG`` -> ``.../cyclotron/config.toml``) is a Rust cycle model's own
configuration -- it may CROSS-CHECK a derived fact, it may not BE its source. Two measured failures
forced this:

1. **The geometry was baked, not read.** The previous version resolved its config through raw
   ``os.environ`` (not :func:`merlin.common.paths.env`), so in any plain process -- pytest, a CLI run,
   an agent sandbox -- ``MERLIN_MUON_CONFIG`` was unset, ``config_path()`` returned the placeholder
   ``/path/to/autocomp/scripts/muon/config_muon.toml``, the TOML parse returned ``{}``, and
   ``cfg.get("num_lanes", 16)`` / ``("num_warps", 8)`` / ``("num_cores", 2)`` published the DEFAULTS as
   facts -- under an evidence string that read ``"config_muon.toml: num_lanes=16, num_warps=8,
   num_cores=2"`` while no config file had been opened at all. Measured, before this change::

       config_path: /path/to/autocomp/scripts/muon/config_muon.toml exists: False
       rtl_present: False
       simt: {"lanes_per_warp": 16, "warps_per_core": 8, "cores": 2, "threads_per_core": 128}

   The numbers happened to match the real config, which made them UNFALSIFIABLE rather than wrong: no
   run could ever distinguish "read from the hardware" from "never read anything".

2. **The perf model and the RTL DISAGREE.** With the paths actually resolved, the elaborated
   ``top_module_hierarchy.json`` for ``RadianceMuonConfig`` contains exactly ONE ``MuonCore`` instance
   (``/ChipTop/system/cluster_prci_domain/element_reset_domain_element/tile_prci_domain/
   element_reset_domain_muon_tile/core``), while the cyclotron config declares ``num_cores = 2``. The
   old code published ``cores = 2`` and a ``64 flop/cycle`` / ``32 GFLOP/s`` peak built on it. The RTL
   wins; the config's reading is kept beside it as a recorded ``cross_check`` disagreement rather than
   silently dropped, because a perf model configured for a different core count is itself a finding.

THREE STATES, never a default
=============================
Every fact is one of:

* ``derived``        -- read out of the RTL, with the token quoted in ``evidence``;
* ``absent``         -- the input that would carry it is not on this machine (no ``$MERLIN_CHIPYARD``,
  no elaboration) -- value ``None``;
* ``undeterminable`` -- the input IS present but carries no sound reading (e.g. the design's fixed
  clocks disagree, so there is no single clock to report) -- value ``None``.

There is no fourth state where a plausible number stands in. A consumer that needs a value it did not
get must say so; that is strictly better than a wrong number nobody can trace.

This module is target-gen for Muon ONLY; it imports nothing Gemmini-specific and never runs the agent.
